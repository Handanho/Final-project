Since we would like to investigate the probability of applying ultrasound in diagnosing liver steatosis. After cleaning and manipulationg the data, we conducted a matrix for ultrasound results.
We calculated its specificity and sensitivity to evaluate its practical use. Besides, a histogram was drawn to visualize the distrbution of all participants' ages and a combined plot was drawn to 
visualize the distribution of plasma triglycerides at different stage of NAFLD. Finally, two t-tests were performed to see whather there were clinical parameters that could be helpful in the assessment
of NAFLD.
