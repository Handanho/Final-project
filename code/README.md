Here are codes of the whole project. We imported all the data into pandas dataframe, we scan for and clean the NaN values for the data frame. Furthermore,
we excluded all the patients with inconclusive results of liver steatosis no matter in biopsy or ultrasound results. Outliers of the columns we were interested in
were also removed. A histogram and one combining plot were drawn. We further conducted a confusion matrix for the evaluation of the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosis.
Moreover, two t-tests were performed to see whether there was a significant difference in other clinical parameters.
