Here are figures of the whole project. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the age of selected samples (after dropping the NaN values and the outliers of the columns we are interested in).
According to the results, most of the remaining 378 patietns are distributed from 30 years old to 65 years old.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of plasma triglycerides level in patients at different NAFLD stage. Patients with higher NAFLD scores have broader range of that, except patients with NAFLD
scores of 6 and 7. Maybe it is due to the small sample sizes.
